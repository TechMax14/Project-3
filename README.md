Project 3 - Weather To Go There

*** Cloning Repo:
        - Open git bash and CD to desired location to clone our repo (i.e. cd C:/Documents/Bootcamp/Project3)
        - then run the clone command (git clone https://github.com/TechMax14/Project-3.git)
        - that should be it!

*** Pushing Code:
        - Whenever one of us wants to push our code from our local computers up to the repo for everyone else to pull down and work on locally, follow these steps.
        - Make sure that the new files/code u want to push up are in the repo location on ur local machine (i.e. C:/Documents/Bootcamp/Project3/Project-3) 
                  *notice "Project3" is a folder that holds our repo "Project-3", sorry for the confusion lol
        - then from that location run "git add ."
                  *check the status prior to see what files (in red) arn't pushed to the repo already (git status)
        - running 'git status' after that should highlight the new files being ready to be committed in green
        - next run 'git commit -m " Your message (i.e. "Adding starter code to repo blah blah blah") "
        - last but not least, run 'git push' and that should update our github repo with whatever files/folders you just committed and pushed 
        - we can discuss in meet-up sessions whether we want to create separate branches for each of us to work in etc. 
                  * we could each make a branch for each member of the team to work on or we can divide the work up into sub-categories and name branches after those but we can discuss later

    "1. Install the following in your dev environment:<br>\n",
    "    a. google-cloud-bigquery: pip.exe install google-cloud-bigquery<br>\n",
    "    b. db-types: pip install db-dtypes<br>\n",
    "2. Install gcloud CLI <br>\n",
    "    a. Install directions (with download link): https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install<br>\n",
    "    > i. pay attention to where it installs!<br>\n",
    "    > ii. It says to leave all the shortcut, open terminal options checked. I received errors when it ran \"gcloud info --run-diagnostics\" and I ignored them for now...<br>\n",
    "    \n",
    "    b. Add this to your PATH environmental variables (for me this was C:\\Users\\vt_be\\AppData\\Local\\Google\\Cloud SDK\\google-cloud-sdk)<br>\n",
    "    c. reboot!<br>\n",
    "    d. open git bash, switch to dev environment<br>\n",
    "    > i. \"gcloud info --run-diagnostics\" now ran without issue<br>\n",
    "    ii. add authentication (this opens browser to connect your google account):  gcloud auth application-default login<br>\n",
    "    \n",
    "    e. I also needed to set up a Big Query Project: mostly followed https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/sandbox<br>\n",
    "    > i. I didn't see the stuff mentioned in #3 but otherwise worked<br>\n",
    "    > ii. Note that when you create the project, an id is generated that is project name - #### (for me BootCamp-Weather:  bootcamp-weather-400118<br>\n",
    "    \n",
    "    f. Add the project to default - back to gitbash: gcloud auth application-default set-quota-project <project-id><br>\n",
